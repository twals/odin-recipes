        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In search of <em>tender, fluffy</em> scrambled eggs? Here are the only ingredients you need, and the chef-approved method for how to make scrambled eggs worthy of any morning. And, no... you don't add milk! Garnish with creme fraiche or sour cream, hot sauce, and chopped herbs.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Whisk eggs with salt until completely combined and very foamy.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over low heat until bubbling. Add whisked eggs; cook, stirring frequently for even, moist curds, until thickened and creamy, but still shiny, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove scrambled eggs from the pan before they begin to look dry, as they will continue to thicken off the heat.</li>
        </ol>
